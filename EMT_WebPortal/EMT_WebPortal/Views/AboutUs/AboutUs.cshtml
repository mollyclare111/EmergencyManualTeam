        <div class="row aboutus-div">
            <p class="col-12">
                The Emergency Manual Team has developed a mobile solution that provides EMTs with quick navigation of their protocol handbook and patient care logging functionality while in the field.
                The protocol data will be uploaded and maintained by the Mountain West Ambulance service administrators through the web portal.
                The goal of our design is minimal user interaction to keeping users’ focus on the patient and not the system.
                To meet the needs of the emergency responder environment our system uses a simple but intuitive UI, allowing access to the data as fast as possible.
